# <ReadMe Generator>

## Description

Transitioning into working with Node and the built-in file system, an attempt to be more efficient came to pass - a ReadMe Generator.

## Installation

This app must be run using node.js . 

## Usage

When you run node on the index.js file of this application, you will be met with a list of questions. When completed, these questions will be the information necessary to populate a ReadMe file, generated in markdown in a separate .md file for you.
